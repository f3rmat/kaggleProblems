Decision Tree: 
1) ID3 paper: https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2FBF00116251.pdf

implementation of the same: https://github.com/f3rmat/kaggleProblems/tree/master/titanic/ID3

This uses information gain wala as: 

-(summation of (p*log2(p)))

Information gain = 

(Expected information required at the root node) - (weighted average of the information required after branching off)

2) CART: This uses gini inmpurity: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning#Gini_impurity

Very well explained here: https://youtu.be/LDRbO9a6XPU?t=262

See the weighted average part of gini impurity. 

Information gain = (gini impurity at parent node) - (weighted average of gini impurity after branching off attribute)

3) C4.5 algorithm: (Quinlan's paper: http://www.cs.ecu.edu/~dingq/CSCI6905/readings/BaggingBoosting.pdf)

implementation: https://github.com/barisesmer/C4.5

well explained here: https://cis.temple.edu/~giorgio/cis587/readings/id3-c45.html

Improved version on ID3 by Quinlan's. The new features (versus ID3) are: (i) accepts both continuous and discrete features; (ii) handles incomplete data points; (iii) solves over-fitting problem by (very clever) bottom-up technique usually known as "pruning"; and (iv) different weights can be applied the features that comprise the training data.
